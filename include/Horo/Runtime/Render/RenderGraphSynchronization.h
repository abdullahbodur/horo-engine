     * transient resources start undefined. Queue roles are resolved through the supplied effective
     * topology, so aliased roles never create a false ownership transfer. Conflicting states within
     * one pass are rejected because the plan cannot insert a pass-internal barrier. A transient's
     * first write emits an explicit `None` to access-state transition; an undefined read is rejected
     * earlier by `CompileRenderGraph` with `RenderGraphErrors::ReadBeforeWrite`.
     *
     * Current graph usages do not yet declare buffer or texture subresource ranges, so this stage
     * deliberately normalizes each use to the whole logical resource. It does not silently claim
     * fine-grained tracking. Likewise, current import/export records carry no required final state;
     * this function cannot invent one, and final boundary-state transitions remain deferred until
     * that graph authoring contract exists. Failure publishes no plan.
     *
     * @param graph Immutable finalized graph.
     * @param schedule Valid schedule compiled from `graph`.
     * @param queues Complete effective queue assignment for every retained pass role.
     * @param importedStates Exact initial state evidence for every non-transient resource.
     * @return Owning normalized plan or a typed actionable validation/allocation failure.
